# Magnetic Ring Surface Defect Dataset (MRSDD)

The MRSDD is a new large-scale industrial defect dataset for benchmarking, which consists of over 10000 acquired images of actual defective magnetic rings. 

We are not yet able to make the entire dataset publicly available. The final content and format of its release still require further discussion and approval from the commissioning party of this defect detection task, given the large scale of MRSDD and the mass of unlabeled images it contains. 

At present, we are authorized to release a subset of our image data for preview purposes.
